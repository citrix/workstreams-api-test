[JP1]Nit  dont think we need to include . at the end of a summary sentence ?
[JP2]Not sure if this is a value or a field. Either works..
[JP3]Not sure if this makes sense to add this string to the description; if YES, consider adding to previous instances.
[JP4]See earlier comment. Not sure we need to specify the expected.
[JP5]Field or value?
[JP6]Can it also be a FQDN, or is that the same as DNS name in this context?
[JP7]A few instances of cloud adding Citrix Cloud not sure if we are talking generic cloud service here, or as it relates specifically to Citrix Cloud
[JP8]Keepalive = 1 word
[JP9]Use field or value or.. ?
[JP10]IX has been instructed to remove all instances of PVS; in this context might be better to write out all bits. Im checking to determine if CAL an approved customer facing term.
